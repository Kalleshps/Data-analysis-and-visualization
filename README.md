# Data-analysis-and-visualization

 â€œData analysis & visualization in IPL[2008-2023]   I do in this project as 
cleaning the huge data set and visualize the data in graphs format like pie chart & bar graph & 
histogram, like that It helps to easy to identify the top players & top batsmen & top bollers & 
top home captains like so on, where I learned [Python & Python libraries as numpy, pandas, 
matplotlib, seaborn & turtel]. This experience helped me enhance Python skills and Data 
visualization skills for various libraries."
